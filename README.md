This is for the Task 1:
The uploaded files are:
1) QOSF_Task1_design.ipynb -  Describe the intent, logic and construction of the quantum circuit.
2) QOSF_task1.ipynb - python code implementation for fixed (given) input and for any generic input (user defined). usage: will ask to enter number of qubits. Once pressed enter need to provide 2 to the power number of qubits in decimal.
3) defs.py and QOSF_task1_parallel.ipynb - code implementation to showcase how to achieve parallelism.
